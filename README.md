# Kakoune Plus Helix

An actually good kakoune config

## Requirements

tmux, for split panes functionality

xdotool, for sending escape key to kakoune to get rid of annoying changelog on *scratch*

clangd, for c++ inline error messages (look up which languague server you need for your lang [kak-lsp](https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp?tab=readme-ov-file#install-language-servers-for-your-desired-languages))

fzf, to open files with a fuzzy finder

xsel, so that copy and pasting from buffer in X11 works

## Explanation

Ctrl+p - to open up panels menu that allows you to open a split view

![multilpe panes](/screenshots/panes.png)

, - to cycle between open panels

Ctrl+o - to open up fzf menu that has many useful shortcuts

![fuzzy finding file](/screenshots/fuzzy_finding.png)

Alt+c - toggle comment lines cursor is on

Alt+p - preview popup parameters that function takes

Alt+Enter - show what the compilation error is on the line

Typing `jk` will go take you from insert mode to normal mode

## Installation

Make backups of `~/.config/kak` and `~/.config/tmux` folders before hand just in case!

Put the following in a file called `install.sh`, make it executable `chmod +x install.sh`, and run it `./install.sh`

```bash

# download source and enter the folder
git clone https://github.com/jmanc3/kakoune-plus
cd kakoune-plus

# copy over kak config and plugins
cp -r kak ~/.config/
cp -r kak-lsp ~/.config/

# copy over tmux config and set it as config source
cp -r tmux ~/.config/
tmux source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf
```

And then add this to your `~/.bashrc`

```bash
function kakoune() {
    local session_name="kak-tmux-$(date +%s%N)"
    tmux new-session -s "$session_name" bash -c "kak \"$@\""
}
alias kak='kakoune'
```

So that when you run `kak`, it'll start it inside a tmux session, so that split pane functionality is available. (The tmux session ends when the kak session ends)


## Notes

For c++, kak-lsp needs to find the generated file `compile_commands.json` in the root or in `build/compile_commands.json` (You can change where it looks for by modifying `kak-lsp/kak-lsp.toml`).

`compile_commands.json` is generated by your build system typically, for instance, for cmake you add `set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)` to your `CMakeLists.txt`

You'll have to look up what to do to generate that file for your c++ project if you want lsp hints
